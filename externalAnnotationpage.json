For It usually indicates that  something Is wrong ��������� the childs  work or pl-n.Vor companions, or.food,  or general ���������nen.U.h! To trace it to its  real source soincflnies needs both  great tact and much firmness on the  mothers part, but no trouble must bo  spared to remove the cause, as excessive nervousness in childhood may,  later on, reappear in a very serious  form. ,  Scalding is, of course, the worst  possible treatment for nervousness of.  any kind, though excessive sympathy  is almost as bad. The child should  be made ^..understand that his fears  and shyness are the results of- ill-  health, and must be conquered by  will-power  duly accomplished by-  nourishing diet, plenty of sleep, and  ���������plent enjoyed exercise out-of-  doors. *   LAST) -OFREVOLUTIONS  re   KebcIIions   Have   Taken  Place  in Chhia than in any other  Country on Keconl.  There are probably more revolts  rebellions and revolutions recorded in  the annals of China than can be resurrected from the histories of all the  nations of the west. This is partly  because Chinese annals of an authentic character go back much further than western annals and partly  because the Chinese, inoffensive and  docile though they seem, are predisposed  to  insurrection.  The tendency has persisted since  the first of the eighteen emperors  of the Hia dynasty mounted his  throne away back in the dim mists  of antiquity when the early Pharaohs  were building their temples by the  Nile and erecting their pyramids in  the  desert.  The Hia dynasty issued from 2.05  to 1766 B.C., when it was overturned  by the Shnng, or Tin, dynasty, an  equally active race, which ruled until  1122 years before the Christian era.  Disaster overtook the Shang Emperors at last, from a rising of the  people under the banners of Chcu.  although Rome had not been bunlt  and the Greeks were still scattered  tribes when they gave way to the  princes of the Ohou line. A protracted  period  of unrest followed.  In many respects the greatest of all  the Chinese Emperors, Kubla Khan  began his reign in 1257, and hold the  throne until his death in 1294. In  these years the nation was more illustrious and powerful than over before A succession of Mongol emperors followed Kubla Khan, principally remembered for their sanction  of the introduction of Christianity.  In 1368 the Ming dynasty was proclaimed upon the ashes of the political  structure built up by the warlike  Mongols, and it ruled successfully  until the Manohus of the North, the,  fierce, well--bui.lt MlChinese, swept  down upon Peking and installed their  own princes in 1651.  The Manchus have never been  numerous, and although they havo  managed to keep their saddles by dint  of cowing the peoples under them,  they have been unable to preserve  absolute order, .and. tranquillity. One  of the first steps they took to impress their sovereignty upon the  country was the publication of an  edict compelling the people to adopt  the pig-tail. The Manchus were  horsemen, and the pig-tai-1 was prescribed as a national institution because, the Manchus contemptuously  said, the Chinese were of the same  status as their horses.  Rebellion after .rebellion marked  the troubled reigns of the Manchu  Emperors, and in most cases the germ  of revolt was first in evidence in one  or other of the_.thrge provinces .that  Playing His Cards  It was the custom of Mr. Cameron  to fall into an easy attitude wherever  he might be. This habit led to an  occasional dialogue of a spicy nature,  and the dialogues led to a small  square package which Mr. Cameron  presented to his wife one night.  What in the world are these? inquired Mrs. Cameron, as the unwrapping of the package revealed .a few  cards neatly marked, -j^or Use, and  two or three dozen marked, For  Show.  Those, my dear, said Mr. Cameron, are for you. to attach, by the  small pin on the under sirle, < to the  various sofa cushions, chair-backs,  and unoccupied wall spaces in this  house. Then neither my head nor  that of any chance visitor will rest in  or on any object designed fov ornament: and once more, even with  Christmas coming every year, and  your friends as loving and generous  as ever, we shallhave a happy home.

CITY   TKIUSUltKJt   KOBB,  Montreal.  City Treasurer Robb of Montreal  has earned the right to retire. For  nearly fifty years he has served his  fellow-citizens faithfully, efficiently  and uncomplainingly. Few men in  the City Hall and very Tew outside it  have an adequate idea of the combination of issues involving millions  and disputes over pennies which the  City Treasurer has to deal with. For  half a century, Mr. Robb untangled  and straightened out and kept in  order this whole complicated fabric  of the Commercial Metropolis  finances in spite of the passive indifference of some Finance Committees and the active efforts of those  who stood to profit by confusion in  the Department.

A general knowledge of the simple  laws of breeding is very necessary in  dealing with any class of stock, and  poultry are no exception to the rule.  For one thing, it is- very unwise, indeed to use related birds, since this  bo often ends in disaster. Sometimes  in-brooding, as it is called, is necessary, but this does not apply to the  ordinary utility poultry-keeper. Many  cases have been known in which quite  close in-breeding has been carried on  with- no apparent ill-effects. On the  other hand, in many more cases, as a  result of using related stock birds,  tho prolificacy and health of a strain  have been very greatly impaired, lho  progeny of related parents generally  possess poor constitutions, they arc  difficult to roar, while they do not  develop so quickly or to so large a  alze its do the chickens of unrelated  stock birds. Another law that should  bo borne In -mind Is that like produces  like, and thus tho bad as well as the  good points are llkoiy to be reproduced in the offspring.  A Point Im Selection.  Uy rigidly excluding all weedy-  looking specimens from the flock a  strain of birds of vigorous constitutions and good type can be built up.  A word as to size may not be out of  place. Very small birds arc decidedly  objectionable, if only because they lay  small eggs; but, on tho other hand, a  very big bird is rarely a good layer,  although she may lay an egg of good  size. The present tendency of the  fancy breeder is to produce birds of  abnormal size in every breed, and  while this is allowable for the purely  table varieties, it is directly opposed  to good laying, and fatal to the utility  qualities of the non-sitting breeds.  While the skilled breeder builds up  his strain by judicious in-breeding,  the novice depends on fresh stock,  each year. Here one of the greatest  difficulties confronts the beginner. It  does not matter how the hens are  selected, no rapid, progress can be  made unless male birds of known laying pedigree are used.  Those who  purchase stock birds entirely from  outward appearance will never build  up a strain of layers.  Wasted Food.  Much waste occurs in many poultry  1 yards so. far as feeding is concerned.  It is impossible, of course, to make  any calculations in this respect, but  probably 25 per cent, more fowls could  .be supported upon the same quantity  of food as is now used. A large proportion of this waste could be saved  if more careful, supervision were  exercised. It is a very common sight  on many farms to see grain, and even  soft food, sometimes, thrown upon the  ground, with the inevitable result that  a considerable quantity is wasted.  When the ground is quite hard there  is no objection, to scattering a little  grain, but great care must-be taken  in this case not to throw down too  much,, for there is no means of collecting it.  Under no circumstances, however,  should the soft food be thrown on the  ground, but it should always be placed  in troughs. A few ounces of food  wasted dally amounts to a quantity in  a year that is truly astonishing. In  nearly every poultry establishment,  even among the most carefully managed, there is more or less wastage  In feeding, generally arising from  giving too liberal a supply. This  might be entirely overcome if only  those having the poultry in charge  could be persuaded to devote a little  more time to the fowls when feeding  them, and give only as much as they  eat up greedily, never on any account  giving any more until every particle  of the last supply has disappeared.  Alfalfa, a Soil Builder  One great virtue of alfalfa, is its  ability to increase the nitrogen content of thesoil. About 77 per cent,  of the air is nitrogen. It is estimated  that there are 35,000 tons over every  acre of land, worth, at the present  rate of 18 cents a pound, over $12,-  000,000, if it could be used. It is  taken out of the air into the soil by  very minute plants called bacteria,  which live in the little nodules found  on the alfalfa roots. It takes about  25,000 bacteria to measure an inch.  They take the nitrogen from the  air and use it in their life processes  and then give it up to the alfalfa  plant in another form. Alfalfa plants  remove a large amount of nitrogen  from the soil, but the bacteria collect  so much that a portion is left for  other plants that follow.  If the soil is too wet, the bacteria  cannot work, and if too hard, the air  containing the nitrogen can not get  to them.  All plants which have the ability  toadd nitrogen to the soil, like alfalfa,  are called legumes. Some legumes  closely related to alfalfa are sweet,  ������������������ red and white clover; some .more  distantly.^JiU;e������Uaist,J3eana.and peas.  ganizer of the American, Federation  of Labor, and business agent of the  HontEJEaJ district Council of ths  United Brotherhood of Carpenters &  Joiners.

DERICK,  Professor of-Botuuy at McGIH College  Give Fowls Plenty Lime  Lime is necessary both for growing  chickens and laying hens. For the  former it is required to assist in the  formation of bone, and in tho latter  for supplying the largest ingredient  of the shells. In 100 ordinary-sided  eggs there are over 20 oz. of pure  .lime, and all of this must be taken  into the system in one form or another. Unless the hens receive a sufficient supply of shell-forming material soft eggs ��������� will result, entailing  a considerable amount of loss, .especially early in the season, when  eggs are scarce. In the^case of young  growing stock lime is also necessary,  for if they are stinted they .will not  possess strong frames, and leg,weakness and other complaints are liable  to ensue. Broken oyster shells is one  , of the best forms in which to supply  it if the birds are on a soil which is  deficient of lime or if they are kept  in confinement. Oyster shells can  generally be procured for nothing,  and it is quite a simple matter to  break them up.  Boiled for Preference.  > French poulterers belive in boiling  the grain. It is put in a pan of water  and boiled until soft enough to be  easily bruised between the finders.  It is claimed that four pints of oats  boiled will fill a pint measure 10  times; four pints of buckwheat boiled  will fill a pint measure 14 times four  pints of corn (maize) boiled will fill  a pint measuro- 15 times, fpur pints  of wheat boiled will a pint measure  10 times, and four points of rye boiled  will fill a pint measure 15 times.  - Water the Hogs.  Keep plenty of water before your  hogs at all times; this applies to  breeding and growing stock as well as  to fattening stock. Water, of course,  has no food value, and, therefore, will  not produce fat or bone or muscle, but  more nutrients will be extracted from  a given- amount of feed by a hog that  is supplied with an abundance of  water than by one that is not getting  all the water it needs.

Not fur from Fort  , in what was  then culled tlie fur west, was once a  ranch house. In those days the American Indian was not kept in coutinued  subjection, and the rancher built his  bouse near enough to the fort to go  there with those of his household for  protection in .case of necessity. The  fort, now that the Indian has been  eliminated, has sunk to DOthingness in  importance, and the ranch house is  but a charred spot, having been burned by the redskins years ago.  Not an hour before its destruction a  couple, a young ouicer from the fort  and a girl, the ranchers daughter,  were sitting on the broad veranda in  the light.of a full moon. Allen Kimball had enlisted in the United States  army because be couid neither be controlled nor control himself., He had  given in to almost every kind of dissipation, and at the end of a spree,  not having the hardihoods ��������� meet his  father and being out of money, in a  tit of desperation he had enrolled himself in a cavalry regiment, choosing  ��������� that arm of the service since it would  send him farthest.from his home.  He had not been long at his station  when  trouble  with the Indians came  on,  and  Kimball  showed   himself so  brave that  he was  rapidly promoted  through   the  noncommissioned grades  and before the fighting was over was  made   a   lieutenant     This , gave   him  heart,  and   he determined  to  redeem  himself with his family.    But a passion for gambling stood In his way.  At those remote posts there was little  or nothing for the men to do except  drink   and   gamble,   and   Lieutenant  Kimball found the temptation to gamble too strong for him.    Once he had  begun to play all caution deserted.him,.  and  he bet  wildly.    The result  was  that he became indebted to his brother officers in large amounts.    One .or  two of bis  creditors in. order to get  what they considered to be their just  dues formed a clique.against him, and  he found himself a cut man, which  is the army expression for one whose  brother officers will not speak to him,  though some dissented from the rest  on the ground that Kimball did not deserve what was inflicted upon him.  Kimball bad formed the acquaint-  ance of Winifred Armour, the ranchmans daughter, at the height of the  reputation he bad made for bravery  and efficiency. .He loved her, .and his  loved was returned. He confessed his  previous life to her and announced his  Intention thereafter to be a credit instead of a disgrace .to hia family. -She  sympathized with ;hlm deeply and  promised him that if ha adhered to  his resolution for a given time she  would .marry him.  But, she said, I will confess that  there is:in the east a man of sterling  worth who has asked me to be his  wife. He is . much older than L and  thus far I respect him only. My love  is yours. If you relapse into your  former condition when I return to.the  east I shall accept hia proposition.  Doubtless she put the matter thus to  furnish an incentive to him to conquer  himself.  He had ridden over to the ranch  house on this moonlight night to bid  her goodby. He had failed to conquer  himself and had lost her. The interview was painful to both.  Well, he said, in one thing I rejoice���������you in time will be happy. Thank  heaven, I am not to drag yon down  with me! You will be a member of a  family, while I���������I am every day expecting an invitation to resign.  Winifred made no reply. What could  she say? She could not find it in her  heart to upbraid him. And there was  nothing she could say to relieve the  mental torture both suffered. She simply put out her band in a mute farewell.  They were both recalled from the  melancholy status existing between  them by hearing distant sounds of a  galloping horse, evidently coming at  full speed. Both listened. The animal was not coming from the direction of the fort, but toward it Kimball knew that the Indians on the  nearby reservation had been unruly,  and something told him (the comer  was a ncessenger bringing a warning. His fear was realized. A horseman, reaching a point in the road opposite the ranch gate, pulled*his horse  back, on .his. haunches an_d cried^oui:  The TiicIlansTre coming! -TEeyTe  right on us!  Without a word Kimball ran for the  stable near the house and in a few  minutes returned, leading Winifreds  mare, saddled and bridled Her father  was away from the ranch, and there  was no one in the house but, employ-  ,ees and servants. They, too, prepnred  for flight Kimball put his companion  on her horse, mounted himself, and  they tore through the open gate and  away toward the ,forL They had  scarcely started when behind them  came that terrible whoop which only  an Indian can give.  The fort was six miles from the  ranch���������not a long distance for aD ordinary ride, but too great to enable  the fugitives to reach safety with a  horde of yelling savages in their rear.  The horses knew that yell and put  forth all their strength.  Scarcely  a   mile  had  been  covered  when the gallop of a single horse was  heard that had evidently distanced the  rest Kimball knew that he was gaining upon  them.  Im going to slow up and Ore, he  said. You go on; dont lose any  time.    Ill overtake you.  He pulled his horse back .on his  haunches and turned him as quickly  as possible, but not too quick, for an  Indian was right on him. Seizing a  repeating rifle that he carried hooked  to his saddle, he fired when the man  was not a hundred yards from him  and dropped him. Then, turning, he  followed Winifred. She had preferred  to reduce her pace, and he consequently soon caught up with her.  Why did you not go on when I  drew rein? he asked. I am doing  this for you, not for myself. lou  know that death is my only refuge.  I shall draw rein every time you  do, was the reply.  You are demented. Those men who  are following us are savages. When  T halt again go on. If you fall into  their hands you will add a .thousandfold to my anguish.  Do you suppose I can ride to safety  leaving you behind to be tortured and  then   murdered ?  You are a woman.    I think of the  agony you will occasion me, the sadness  for your  loss that  will-.be for  others.  There was no reply to this.  On   the   two   galloped,   maintaining  the distance between themselves and  those  behind,   who .were .delayed  on  - coming to .the body of the buck who  had been shot    Here they divided, a  part remaining with the dying Indian,  the   others   continuing   the   pursuit  Half the distance between the ranch  .. house and the fort had been passed  when suddenly-a red.glare;was;added  to the pale light of the moon.   . Kimball said nothing.    He knew that the  . glare came from the burning of the  ranch  house.    On, .on they sped, the  glare  adding  to  their  terror  of  the  whooping savages behind them.  Again the footfalls of the pursuing  horses, by their varying distinctness,  indicated. that the Indians were separating in accordance with the speed of  their ponies. Then Kimball saw that  ,he might save the girl by sacrificing  himself.  Theres a rise in the ground ahead,  he said. Im going to stop there and  take them as they come on. Hurry to  the fort. With what.delay to,the savages I cause you .can.certainly reach  it  No!     No!   cried   Winifred,- who  knew   very   well   what   this   meant  Keep on.    We shall soon meet a force  from the garrison.  Either we or.that red light will be  the first news they will get that the  Indians are on the warpath.  I will remain with you.  Go!  he cried.    They had reached  the crest, and, reining in his-horse, he  dismounted.   Seeing that she, too, had  stopped, he said, My only chancels to  hold them at bay till you can send as  sistance.  She hesitated a moment; then, thinking that be might be right she gave  her horse a cut and dashed onward.  Kimball, who had trained his horse  for Indian fighting, forced him to lie  down on the crest, and, placing himself  on   his  stomach   behind   him,   waited  for   the   first  Indian  to  come   within  range.    But a few moments passed before, on a  rise in the ground, a  hun  dred yards away against the glare of  the burning ranch house, appeared the  silhouette of an Indian.   The man was  coming   swiftly,   advancing   straight  toward Kimball.  For the few seconds  the savage was on the crest he seemed  to be standing stilL    The officer used  these few seconds to draw a bead on  the mans  breast and fired.    The In  dian rode down on to the lower ground,  his arms thrown-up above;hls  bead,  then fell backward, not fifty feet from  his enemy.

Nor ,did he wish to  remain to know that the girl he worshiped was in possession of another.  He began a rapid fire at the advancing  Indians.  This is all that Is known of that remarkable battle in which a single man  killed five redskins and wounded four  more. His own account and the Indians he put out of the fight .are all  there was to tell the story, and he remembers nothing more than has been  given here. A troop of cavalry from  the fort met a party of Indians and  put them to flight In the road where  the meeting took place, unconscious  and badly wounded, the soldiers found  Lieutenant Kimball. When he came to  himself he was being carried ou a  stretcher in the moonlight. ,and beside  him walked Winifred Armour. Bending down, she .whispered to him:  My life is-yours, to help you.  A wild joy triumphed over all else,  but he could reply only by a .pressure  of the hand.  In the army bravery overtops almost  any offense.

J I was born in Madrid of eminent  though;not noble parents. When 1 was  sixteen I��������� formed the acquaintance of  Alonzo Gonzales, an anarchist.  ) I entered -the university a year before Gonzales. left it, and It ,was during this year that I was converted to  the theories of the anarchists. There  were others of our, set ...that were captured by.Gonzales,;amqqg them a girl,  Dolores Sierra, who had been a playmate of mine. But Gonzales, so far as  he was able, kept his converts apart;  maintaining, great secrecy in all his  proselyting work. I conceived a great  reverence for him, which later was  turned to horror. When I was nineteen, he persuaded me to join one of  the anarchist circles of Madrid- I had  been initiated only a few months when  the society decided to put out of the  way. a statesman high in power, who  was considered an obstacle to anarchistic principles. One inight when I  went to a meeting of the circle it was  announced that lots were.to be drawn  with a view todetermining some member who should assassinate, the person .  in question.  I Up to this moment I had been fascl-.  nated by the romance I conceived to  pervade these efforts to equalize .the  social strata. When I put my hand  in a hat to draw a bit of.paper that  might compel me to kill a man and  probably be executed myself as a  felon, the illusion vanished like a mirage, or, rather, it was changed into  repulsion, and when the paper I drew  was opened and I saw by a skull and  crossbones on it that I had, drawn the  order to commit murder I .was frozen  with horror. | ���������.  I   I did now what I should have done  In the beginning���������I made a confidant  of my  father.    He saw at once  the  terrible position in which I was placed,  but, instead of making it worse for,me  by reproach, kept his head and considered what it would be best for me to  do.    The  result  of  his  deliberations  was that I. should pass out of existence���������that   is,   that   I   should   disappear from the world as myself and reappear as far away as possible from  the place of my exit as some one else.  i  A few days later, with what ready  money I needed and certificates of deposit in the Bank of France, payable  to me as Ebenezer Swift, disguised as  an old man, I left the city.    My object  in taking an English name was that  I   proposed   to   settle   eventually   in  America, _and I intended to give out  dent funds to carry me for twelve  months. We knew that my family  iwould be watched, that my location  might be discovered; hence there was  to be no communication oftener that  that interval.  ) One day, so I learned long afterward, Dolores Sierra went to my  mother and told her that for my  safety she must know where I was,  stating that the circle to which I had  .belonged had condemned me to death,  that they knew where I was and  that I must be warned at once. Without thinking what she was doing my  mother told her where I would be  found in New York. My father was  !absenv������at the time and when he returned my mother, having learned that,  ��������� she had been indiscreet in giving my  [whereabouts/ did not dare tell him  what she had done. She trusted Dolores- implicitly and preferred to rely  on her to protect me rather than reveal  her action to my father. The consequence was that I was not advised of  the matter.  j Living with a sword suspended over,  ones head is by , no means pleasant  In my case it brought on a nervous  breakdown. The summer wa* on, and  I was advised to go up to the Cats-  kill mountains. I therefore went to  one of the hotels on the summit,.hoping to recover my lost nervous vigor.  I had not been there a week before I  met with a great surprise. Walking  out one afternoon, I met a girl coming  (toward me, and when we met who  /should it ,be but Dolores Sierra.  | ,Cut off as I had been for more than  a year from every one I had known  before, her appearance gave me a  thrilL I sprang toward her with a  cry of joy. Instead of meeting me in  the same spirit she stood as if .paralyzed, all the color leaving her face.  I Dolores I exclaimed. What  brings you here?  j I am so surprised,-she stammered,  ������������������at meeting you that I��������� She could  get no further.  } But, Dolores, how strange that 1  should meet you of all others, and the  very one I would.rather meet���������  1 She put her hand to her.breast Her  breath was coming quick. For a .moment I thought she would -fall. I  sprang forward to catch her, but she  [waved me back. I waited till she had  jsomewhat recovered, when she said to  ime:  6  My meeting you unexpectedly after  your sudden disappearance has startled me. It was reported that you had  been made away with by the anarchists.  But what has that to do with your  coming to America?  To meet one-in the flesh-whom you  have supposed to be dead you .must  admit is liable to cause a shock, she  replied without noticing my question.  But-  Come; let us walk together.  By slow degrees she brought out that  she had come to America because there  are fields open to women in which they  may make their living. She had no  dowry, and in Spain a. dowry was necessary to marriage; therefore she preferred to be occupied among those of  her own sex who were used to work  and where there was work to do.  There is no work to,do up in these  mountains, I said.  The question took her unawares..  That her presence in America was not  explained by anything she had told me  I did not doubt But what was her  object In coming? As we walked on  I probed the matter, wondering all the  while at the strange occurrence. Then  suddenly a theory suggested itself to  me. Might she not have come to protect me? And would she have come  all the way across an ocean on my account except for one reason���������that she  loved me? 7  But such a suspicion I was not inclined to make known to Dolores.  Nevertheless it caught my fancy and  brought a wild joy to my heart Set  apart from those with whom 1 had  been reared, dead to every living being I had known, the baresuspicion  that this girl loved me and. loved me  so well that she had come all the way  from my beloved Spain for me was  like a new birth to me. With this girl  for a companion I would be willing to  live on in my changed existence.     I said no more to her as to the reason for her coming. In any event it  was her secret, provided she chose to  keep it a secret, and not mine. I found  that she was stopping at a house not  far from mine, and there later on I  left her, having arranged to call and  walk with _her, the,next morning........._..  And so IdTcT. In that mountain, air  we strolled, I invigorated not only :by  its purity, but by the companionship  of Dolores. But while I grew strong  she. seemed to be wasting away.  Something w,as distressing her. I asked her to confess it to me, and she  declined. I pressed her to do so, and  in a spasm of feeling she cried:   If you dont leave I shall go.mad.   To express my sympathy I took her  hand in mine, but she snatched it  away.  One would suppose, I said, wounded, that a viper had touched you.  Or that you had touched a viper,  she replied. ,  I was looking her in the face at the  time she.said this and saw her bite her  lip. Perhaps the words .and the action should have given me a clew to  her .secret, but they did not I was as  much puzzled as ever.  One day when we were walking together we met a woman with dark  hair and eyes.  That woman, I said, came either  from Spain or Mexico. At any rate,  shes Spanish.  I turned to look at Dolores and saw  that she was struggling with some  emotion. But by this time I bad.glv  en over questioning her upon these  strange matters and said nothing. To  attempt to extract from her ,v.helr  cause seemed only to madden ber.  We met the Bame woman again the  next day, and I saw on her faoe a  look that assured me that there was  some understanding between them:  but, as.before, I refrained from apeak  ing,of it  One  night I  awoke  with  a  start.  The moon, shining In at the window  showed   a   womans   figure   standing  , near.    She   held   something   in    om*  hand, while with the forefinger of the  .other she was smearing what she held  Then   suddenly she  flung the  article  out of the window.    A ray of moon  light struck it and revealed what 1  ,  took to be a. knife.  I rose, supporting myself on my elbow, and asked:  Whos there?  A hand grasped mine���������a hand ,col������  .as .ice.  Hush! I am Dolores.  What are you doing here?  Dont interrupt me while I tell you  and what to do. Our lives depend  upon it I came,.to America,ordered  by ;the circle to kill,you. ,A woman  was sent with me to .see .-that.I did the  -work. She is the Spanish woman we  met Tonight I told her that I .would  come to your room, plunge a- dagger  into your heart and throw the dagger  out of the window to prove to her  .that I have done .the deed. I have  smeared it with beefs blood. She Is  to leave by ,one route, I by another;  she by, the stony-clove and I by the  clove leading down, eastward. .Goodby!

Hide yourself. ;If yon are. discovered alive I must die.  .**But Dolores, -darling, this woman, not hearing, of a murder here, .win  know that you, have not done the  .deed.  I have thought .of that   But, she  ,wiil not stop till she ,reaches Madrid.*  Go with me, sweetheart    I .love  you and so far as i, can .will protect  you.  That was many years ago. I; recall  how, long before day -we met at the ,  mouth of the clove; how we walked  ten miles to n railway station and,  boarding a train, went so,far as those  who had known, us .gRexe -cpaceraad  oat of existence,     .....

For several months Dorland had not  been  in  good  standing  in  his club.  Several  times he asked- for  his  release, only to be refused, and piqued  by this ihe competed unattached. This  earned the wrath of the officials of,  the club, and they preferred charges  against him, with the result, that when  the   meeting   was   held   every   one  (present but Harry Smith, the captain  :of the club, voted to expel him. Smith  was   present,   but   refused  to   vote.  Dorland   took   his   expulsion   grace-  ���������fully.    In. fact he seemed pleased.  Dorland has been in the athletic  .game for five years. He has won  many titles. Besides the Pastime A.  (C. he was amember.of .the Seventy-  ���������jflrst Regiment. Before developing  into a champion both the New York  I A. C. and the Irish-American A.

X  CARE FOR THE TEETH!        It is  useless  to  say  to  intelligent  persons    that   the   teeth   should   be  ���������brushed at .least twice every day, with  ; unfailing  regularity,  and that  selection of the. toothbrush is a matter deserving some ��������� thought.    Anyone  who  will buy a cheap, inferior toothbrush,  and   spend   money   on   things   more  ornamental and less useful, does not  : deserve good  teeth.  For ordinary use, a good, stiff brush  that fits the mouth is the best to use,  .and  do  not be  afraid  to  use  it.    A  ! prominent dentist once told me that  a   tooth - kept  polished   would   never  ���������decay.    This itself is an argument in  favor of the untiring use of the toothbrush.  Some good dentifrice should be used  two or three times a week, and there  is nothing superior to plain prepared  chalk. It forms the basis of all the  expensive tooth-powders, and is just  as .good as the best of them. If one  objects to the flat taste of the chalk,  it can be easily converted into a  pleasant dentifrice by flavoring with  extract of rose.  A still more effective dentrifice is  prepared, chalk and powdered orris  root, and about a half teaspoonful  of finely shaved Castile soap. This  formula may be used a lifetime and  never be improved upon, as it contains  every essential for cleaning and  whitening-the teeth.

Wlhen  clean, rinse through several waters,  wipe with a soft towel, but do not  rub them; then take off carefully and  hang in a draught to ��������� dry, pulling  ���������them into shape occasionally. Pure  white gloves should be hung In the  sunshine, but delicate tints should  be dried wrong-side out in the shade.  The delicate threads of such, gloves ������..  can not stand rubbing on the washboard. Ail rents and repairs should  be made before washing.  Water of Eternal Youth  The beauties of the Austrian court  used a lotion, which was so effectual  ���������In keeping the face smooth and frea  from winkles, even in the aged, that  - they named it the water of eternal  youth.  Some one has recently divulged the  oecret of this wonderful, though exceedingly simple wrinkle; lotion,  which in her gratitude she has similarly dubbed as a .preserver of youth.  One. ounce pure saxolite (powdered),  dissolved in a half pint of which haze!  ���������thats all there is to it.

In  repose, the bird, with its delicate  ash-grey and white plumage, harmonises so completely in tone with its  environment that it becomes one with  its natural surroundings. Even , on  a flat beach or shore, it may  pass for a fragment of rock or wooden  stake, or some other long-shore object,  until  it moves.  A patient fisher is the heron, but  when Its prey comes within reach tha  long neck curves and the rapier-like  bill iG shot out quickly and unerringly.  The Dawick-Herony is a good instance of the attachment of the species to one locality, as nests are to  be found there at the present day;  and, so far back as 1497, Quyk  (living) herounis were being supplied from Dawikkls to the King,  as is stated in the Accounts of the  Lord High Treasurer.  *������*M������������*i������#������ua������^������������?tiii}S-Tt,iEirr.T jti.ut.-AV ���������������*su*ie}JAr,a.t-&?.i,tt)ir-*T*BUM0~**r*.*  If your Grocer has not  Five Roses Flour  On hand you can get it at the  Abbotsford Feed  and  Grain Store  J.
